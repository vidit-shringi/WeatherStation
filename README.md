 a shell script that installs the necessary packages, clones and compiles the pifmrds program, and then runs the Python GUI program to read data from a DHT11 sensor.
  make it executable using chmod +x script.sh, and then run it using ./script.sh.

Please note that this is a very basic example and might not work perfectly. For real applications, you would need to handle exceptions, manage resources properly, and probably use a more efficient method for reading the sensor data.

Also, please note that Tkinter is a Python library for creating GUIs. Bootstrap is a CSS framework for designing websites and web applications, and itâ€™s not directly applicable to Python GUIs. If you want to make your Tkinter GUI more attractive, you can use custom themes and styles, or use a library like ttkthemes.
